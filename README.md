# MiniTex

MiniTex is a text typesetting and rendering library that can be used on the Web and WeChat mini programs.

MiniTex should be used in conjunction with Skia CanvasKit, which can use the Text Renderer of Web Canvas2D to achieve text typesetting and rendering capabilities without loading additional font files.

For Skia CanvasKit, the benefits are very obvious. Users no longer need to download multi-language fonts.

MiniTex is designed for Skia CanvasKit, and its interface is fully compatible with Skia Paragraph.

MPFlutter uses MiniTex to render text.
